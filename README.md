This pipeline was originally developed to undertake biomechanical feature selection for a single-leg forward hop in our ACL-reconstructed knee study as described in Sritharan et al. 2022. above. It was subsequently adapted for examining bi-lateral tasks, specifically a novel step-down-and-pivot task in our hip/groin pain study.
